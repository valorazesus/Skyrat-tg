2023-08-03:
  GoldenAlpharex:
  - rscadd: A Hemophage's pulsating tumor will now corrupt nearby internal organs,
      hijacking them for its own purposes... Meaning that a Hemophage's organs (outside
      of the tumor itself) can be replaced by any other organs of the same kind, and
      after a minute, get corrupted and become functional Hemophage organs again.
  - qol: Corrupted organs now decay 10 times slower when no tumor is present in their
      body, taking around 100 seconds instead of 10 to fully decay. That means you
      finally have time to deal with it before the organs are fully dead, but still
      not that much.
  - qol: A Hemophage's pulsating tumor can now be coronary-bypassed more than once,
      granted that it spent at least some time in an alive person's body between the
      two bypasses! Yay for regeneration!
  - bugfix: Hemophage's corrupted organs no longer start rapidly decaying after going
      through the SAD, getting your preferences re-applied or otherwise even getting
      ahealed.
  - refactor: Hemophage code has been severely refactored, moving all of the organ-specific
      behavior to the actual organs, meaning that the species itself doesn't handle
      Hemophage-specific bodily functions anymore. Yay for customizability!
  - code_imp: Hemophage code has been better spread out across multiple files, to
      be easier to sift through and find exactly what you want.

      no longer leak their identity via Text to Speech

  - spellcheck: Renames the fugitive pinpointer to the bounty shuttle pinpointer.
  - bugfix: bluespace RPED can be put in bags again without dragging them into their
      storage slots
  - bugfix: normal RPED exchanges parts & displays part info again
  - bugfix: BoH bombing now correctly requires two bags to be done.
  - balance: The strong-arm implant's punches now respect armor.
  - spellcheck: While using an arm with the strong-arm implant to punch people, you
      no longer kick them; your implant's in your arm, after all!
